## Simple Flask implementation

This repo is an extension of the https://github.com/rnplett/FlaskBareDash repo which covers off a step by step installation process for a VERY simple implementation. Reference that for a step by step installation procedure.

This repo takes it one step further to deploy a simple application using Flask.

Start the MainEvent.py app as follows:
```
For Windows:
>set FLASK_APP=MainEvent
>flask run

For all other systems:
FLASK_APP=MainEvent.py flask run
```

After you issue the above command you can now put the following url into your web browser to test this simple vote collecting app.
